In this work it has been studied how different immune  system  variables influence the levels of clinical markers. For this task, several clustering algorithms were 
applied in order to find different profiles of immune systems using clinical parameters. Clusters were analyzed and explained by a PLS-DA model. Significant differences 
between clusters in response variables were found. A certain set of characteristics such as ‘Albumina’, ‘PCR’, ‘IL-6’ and ‘PC_perd_peso’  were observed as the most 
relevant ones.
